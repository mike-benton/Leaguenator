Mike Benton and Adam Ledet
Leaguenator - a League of Legends Twitch Stream Recommender

We split the workload very evenly - I implemented the Twitch API, Adam implemented the League API.
I implemented the ES6 Custom Class.
Adam implemented most of the AJAX calls.

This project was hindered by the League API which offers a very low amount of requests per minute as well as making us get a new key every 24 hours.

We used the League API and the Twitch API for this project.
We used local storage to store the last term searched.

We used Vue.js as our MVVM Framework.

I would grade ourselves an 80% on this project.
This is taking into account a -5% for using querySelector and a -10% for missing cloud storage.
I believe the webapp itself does some neat things and we definitely challenged ourselves with the League API.
